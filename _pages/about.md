I am a doctoral student in the Network Systems Laboratory ([NSLab](https://www.kth.se/cos/research/nslab/network-systems-laboratory-1.621857)) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and I am doing research under the supervision of Professor [Dejan Kostic](https://people.kth.se/~dejanko/) and Professor [Gerald Q. Maguire Jr.](https://people.kth.se/~maguire/) I have received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (Electronics) from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/), Tehran, Iran and My M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (Digital Electronic Systems) from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en), Tehran, Iran.

Research
======
My research interests include computer networks, computer architecture, and compilers. During my doctoral studies, I am trying to improve the performance of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) service chains by using low-level optimization techniques. You can read more in my [licentiate thesis](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1305108&dswid=947).

We exploited the characteristics of non-uniform cache architecture (NUCA) in recent Intel processors to introduce a new memory management scheme. The results of our work showed that our proposed scheme could reduce the tail latencies in latency-critical Network Function Virtualization (NFV) service chains by 21.5%. Furthermore, our work demonstrated that optimizing the computer systems and taking advantage of nanosecond improvements could have a higher impact on the performance of networking applications.
