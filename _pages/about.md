I am a distributed systems researcher at NVIDIA. Before joining NVIDIA, I was a senior researcher in the network intelligence unit at RISE. I completed my doctoral studies in the Network Systems Laboratory ([NSLab](https://www.kth.se/blogs/nslab/)) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology under the supervision of Professor [Dejan Kostic](https://dejankosticgithub.github.io/index.html) and Professor [Gerald Q. Maguire Jr.](https://people.kth.se/~maguire/) I have received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (Electronics) from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/), Tehran, Iran and my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (Digital Electronic Systems) from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en), Tehran, Iran.

Research
======
My research interests include computer networks and networked systems. During my doctoral studies, I improved the performance of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) service chains running at 100/200 Gbps by using low-level optimization techniques. You can read more in my [licentiate thesis](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1305108&dswid=947) and [doctoral dissertation](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-323599). To read the highlight of my research in Swedish, please check the [Framtidens Forskning](https://framtidensforskning.se/2022/06/17/optimerar-cacheminnet-for-snabbare-internettjanster/)'s article called "Optimerar cacheminnet f√∂r snabbare internettj√§nster".

We use large language models (LLMs) to extract useful information from stateful network functions and find the optimal RSS configuration to minmize shared memory accesses.

<br />
We (i) characterize the performance of IOMMU & IOTLB on recent Intel Xeon Scalable & AMD EPYC processors at 200 Gbps and (ii) explore the possible opportunities to mitigate its performance overheads in the Linux kernel. Our evaluation shows that using hugepage-backed buffers can completely recover up-to-20-percent throughput drop introduced by IOMMU.

We systematically study the impact of temporal and spatial traffic locality on the performance of commodity servers equipped with high-speed network interfaces. Our results show that (i) the performance of a variety of widely deployed applications degrade substantially with even the slightest lack of traffic locality, and (ii) a traffic trace from our organization reveals poor traffic locality as networking protocols, drivers, and the underlying switching/routing fabric spread packets out in time (reducing locality). To address these issues, we built Reframer, a software solution that deliberately delays packets and reorders them to increase traffic locality. Despite introducing ¬µs-scale delays of some packets, we show that Reframer increases the throughput of a network service chain by up to 84% and reduces the flow completion time of a web server by 11% while improving its throughput by 20%.

We present [PacketMill](https://packetmill.github.io/), a system for optimizing software packet processing, which (i) introduces a new model to efficiently manage packet metadata and (ii) employs code-optimization techniques to better utilize commodity hardware. PacketMill grinds the whole packet processing stack, from the high-level network function configuration file to the low-level userspace network (specifically DPDK) drivers, to mitigate inefficiencies and produce a customized binary for a given network function. Our evaluation results show that PacketMill increases throughput (up to 36.4 Gbps - 70%) & reduces latency (up to 101 us - 28%) and enables nontrivial packet processing (e.g., router) at ‚âà100 Gbps, when new packets arrive >10√ó faster than main memory access times, while using only one processing core.

We study the current implementation of Direct Cache Access (DCA) in Intel processors, called Data Direct I/O (DDIO) technology. Our paper shows that it is important to understand the details of DDIO and to tune/optimize it appropriately for a given Internet service to achieve high-performance, especially with the introduction of multi-hundred-gigabit networks. A preliminary version of this paper has been presented in the [EuroSys'20](https://www.eurosys2020.org/) poster session.

We exploited the characteristics of non-uniform cache architecture (NUCA) in recent Intel processors to introduce a new memory management scheme. The results of our work showed that our proposed scheme could reduce the tail latencies in latency-critical Network Function Virtualization (NFV) service chains by 21.5%. Furthermore, our work demonstrated that optimizing the computer systems and taking advantage of nanosecond improvements could have a higher impact on the performance of networking applications.
